## TODOs and Fixes

- [ ] General Refactor
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] There might be a bug in the unshift or get method of DoublyLinkedList
- [ ] Update Doubly Linked List so that it begins with index 0 and not index 1
- [ ] what if the array is empty or has only one element or already sorted? (cf. src/algorithms/sorting/index.ts)
- [ ] optimization: alternative implementation of quickSort without creating new arrays (cf. src/algorithms/sorting/index.ts)
- [ ] make a circular linked list + refactor (cf. src/data-structures/linked-lists/singly-linked-list.ts)
- [ ] fix @audits
- [ ] add interfaces for binaryTree.ts
- [ ] redo binaryTree search methods (excessive if statements)
- [ ] add priorityQueue to heap.ts
- [ ] Implement Hash Table
