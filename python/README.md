# Data Structures for Evil and some Good

- **Dynamic Connectivity:** The Empire from Star Wars has a dynamic connectivity issue. They need to keep tabs on all their citizens. They have gathered all the data on their citizen, now all that remains is to have a system of tracking them. Since citizens are rather dynamic individuals who change their minds and alliances etc, the Empire machinery needs to be thorough and always maintain order. To do that they need to know which group each citizen belongs. Enters: Union-Find from the Dark side
- [ ] Quick Union and Quick Find: Lazy bum of an underpaid Star scientist builds this to maintain dynamic connectivity. The problem is that it is too slow to be useful. By the time the program finds and establish connections, the citizens have already changed their alliances.
- [ ] Weighted Quick Union and Find
- [ ] Weighted Quick Union and Find with Path Compression (add a line to the existing code)
- [ ] Rebellion would breakout is RebelAlliance (Root of the Tree) finds a connection to the BottomAlliance (Bottom root of the tree)
- Monte Carlo joins the Empire and finds the probablity for Rebellion percolation
